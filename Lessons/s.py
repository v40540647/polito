# To open a file outside of our text, we us the funct'on open()

#If you open a file for reading you must use
#variable = open("Filename with abrr at last for ex txt" , "The reason you open this file for ex r for Reading w for Writing ")
#If i dont use variable, I wont be able to use the result

#Reason
#if I use r , it means that I am using it just to read ,
#If I use w , it means I am going to change it.In writing if the Filename does not exist , a new file is created and typed on it. If the file exist, it DELETES the info inside and makes it clear rto type.open

#!!! You must close the file with variable.close() (If you dont you will lose point on exam) !!!!

#line = variable.readline() makes 1 line read
#if readline starts to return nothing, it means that its over or you have empty lines on the txt editor

#Readline returns string
 
#On strings , you must use two \ "c:Homework\\pyhton\\file4.py"
#on programs you need to use \
